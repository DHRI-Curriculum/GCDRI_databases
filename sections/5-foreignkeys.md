# Relating Tables with Foreign Keys

At this point, we're going to create a second table called "students" to illustrate the relational nature of relational databases. We use the same syntax that we used to create the "programs" table, but with one extra element: *a foreign key*. Let's work in a new file that we call `students.py`.

As before, create a connection to the "first.db" database:

```python
# import sqlite library
import sqlite3

# create a database and make a connection.
conn = sqlite3.connect("first.db")
cursor = conn.cursor()
```

Create a table called "students" with a field for: (1) a primary key, (2) student name, and (3) a foreign key that will reference the "programs" table. If the SQL looks like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
	id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
	student VARCHAR,
	id_program INTEGER,
	FOREIGN KEY (id_program) REFERENCES programs(id) -- this establishes the reference!
);
```
Then our Python file should look like this:

```python
# import sqlite library
import sqlite3

# create a database and make a connection.
conn = sqlite3.connect("first.db")
cursor = conn.cursor()

sql = """CREATE TABLE students (
	id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
	student VARCHAR,
	id_program INTEGER,
	FOREIGN KEY (id_program) REFERENCES programs(id)
)"""

cursor.execute(sql)

conn.commit()

```

The foreign key points to a primary key in another table, in this case the `programs` table. This relationship is specified with the clause `FOREIGN KEY (id_program) REFERENCES programs(id)`, which links the "id_program" field in the "students" table to the "id" field in the `programs` table.

All records in the `students` table must point to a valid primary key in the `programs` table.

The last step is to add some data to the new "students" table. Try adding some data on your ownâ€”if you get stuck, a solution is [here](solution2.sql).

Remember:

- The primary key will be generated automatically.
- The foreign keys must be entered manually 
- You decide which program to associate with each student.

We will make use of the foreign key in the next step.
