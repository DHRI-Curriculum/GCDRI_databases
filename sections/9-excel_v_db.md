#Time to pause and reflect

###*Why would you learn how to use relational databases when you already know Excel*?


1. #####Data integrity  
	- Databases force every value in a particular field to be one data type  

2. #####Volume! Volume! Volume!  
	- Does the thought of working with a 98,000-row Excel spreadsheet make you queasy? What about 5 million rows?

3. #####Working with multiple related data sets  
	- Is anyone not doing this???  

4. #####Asking detailed questions about your data  

5. #####Connecting your data  
	- Databases are ready to plug into other applications
