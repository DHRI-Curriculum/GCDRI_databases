###SQL + Python = Awesome!  

You can create a program to interact with a database by embedding SQL syntax in a Python script (using the sqlite3 library)  

Let's write a short program that asks a user for a keyword and returns all records from the database that contain the keyword.  

####Step 0: Create a file called "nypl_search.py" from the command line, then open the file in Sublime  
_**Hint:** Use_ `touch` to create the file  


####Step 1: Write the pseudocode in "nypl_search.py"

```Python
# import sqlite3 library

# connect to the database

# say hello to the user

# ask the user for a keyword

# search the database for the keyword

# return a list of records from the database that contain the keyword
```
